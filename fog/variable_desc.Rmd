Firm/call identifiers:

* `permno`: CRSP firm identifier
* `call_date`: Date of the call
* `file_name`: Call identifier in StreetEvents

The following variables are by "category" (i.e., analyst or company, presentation or Q&A):

`fog`is the Gunning (1958) fog index. The following are inputs to `fog = 0.4 * (percent_complex + num_words/num_sentences`.

* `num_words`: Number of words
* `percent_complex = 100 * num_complex_words/num_words`
* `num_sentences`: Number of sentences
* `num_complex_words`: Number of "complex" words (words with more than three syllables)

`num_jargon_words`: Number of three-syllable words from list of top 100 complex words by two-digit SIC code

The following three call-category-level variables are a decomposition of fog (add them up to get fog):

* `fog_jargon`: Portion of the "percent_complex" component attributable to top 100 complex words by two-digit SIC code
* `fog_special`: Portion of the "percent_complex" component *not* attributable to top 100 complex words by two-digit SIC code
* `fog_words_sent`: Portion of fog related to words per sentence

`prop_fl_sents`: Proportion of sentences that are forward-looking

`word_count`: Word count using Python's Natural Language Toolkit (counts words differently from Perl module used for fog)

These call-category-level variables are from Loughran and McDonald (2013?):
`litigious`, `positive`, `uncertainty`, `negative`, `modal_strong`, `modal_weak`

The following variables are call-level variables based on within-call regressions:
`r_squared`, `num_obs`, `constant`, `slope`, `mean_analyst_fog`, `mean_manager_fog`
